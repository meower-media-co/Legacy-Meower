A repo offering legacy support for Scratch-based Meower, also known as Yoom. Created and maintained by MikeDEV.

## What is this repo for?
This repo, Legacy-Meower-Yoom, is a amalgamation of old and new ideas. Fundamentally, this is what this repo seeks to accomplish:
1. Perserve Meower history.
2. Rebrand Scratch-based Meower as Yoom.
3. Provide security fixes and enhancements.
4. Add support for new features.
5. Offer Meower-derived projects official code and technical support.
6. Upgrade unsupported and/or historical clients to use Cloudlink 4.

Note: All builds here will only receive Cloudlink version upgrades and will not be receiving feature upgrades beyond Beta 6.
