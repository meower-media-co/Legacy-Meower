# Legacy-Meower
A repo offering legacy support for retired Meower clients.

> **Note**

This repo seeks to accomplish:
1. Preservation of Meower's history.
2. Provide security fixes and enhancements.
3. Offer Vanilla-Meower-based projects official code and technical support.
4. Upgrade unsupported and/or historical Vanilla clients to use CL4.
