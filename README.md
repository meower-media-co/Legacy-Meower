# Legacy-Meower-Yoom
A repo offering legacy support for Scratch-based Meower. Created and maintained by MikeDEV in response to the New Meower project.

## What is this repo for?
This repo, Legacy-Meower-Yoom, is a amalgamation of old and new ideas. Fundamentally, this is what this repo seeks to accomplish:
1. Perserve Meower history.
2. Rebrand Scratch-based Meower as Yoom ("Your Own Online Messenger"). (Yet TBD)
3. Provide security fixes and enhancements.
4. Add support for new features.
5. Offer Meower-derived projects official code documentation and technical support.

## New features
As part of the New Meower project, some of the new features currently in development include:
* API-based backend-and-frontend communication.
* CloudLink enhancements and bugfixes
* Communities, better direct/group chats, and forums.
* Images and emoji support.
* Instant notifications
* Code optimizations and documentation
* Offer Adacraft's Browser extension support to retire Meower's PIRE ("Pen Item Rendering Engine").
